QRCode is a project in Java, it is meant to build from scratch a QRCode. You give to the program an URL and it will output an image, the corresponding QRCode.

Speleo is a project in C++ where random mazes are built and the goal is to do a frequency analyze, when changing the parameters, to know if there exists a path from top to bottom. The goal was to do a project in a language that I'm not familiar with to see how I'll adapt.
